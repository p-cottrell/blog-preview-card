## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS custom properties  
- Flexbox  
- Mobile-first workflow  
- BEM naming convention  
- Local fonts with `@font-face`

### What I learned

This challenge reinforced my skills in building clean, semantic layouts using just HTML and CSS. I learned how to:

- Load fonts locally using `@font-face`
- Use `display: flex` for vertical alignment and spacing
- Create responsive cards with subtle shadows and padding
- Apply consistent spacing with margin and padding units
- Keep class names clean and modular with BEM
